## New entity **Templates** for Panels has been added
Templates on Panel allow you to quickly create and configure sensor sources. Template consists of 2 parts Filters and Source settings. 
Filter part includes 2 filters:
* **Folders** filter - allows you to select in which folder you want to search for sensors. Supports multiselect logic. Default value is **Any**.
* **Path** tempalte - sensor path template to be added to Panel. It supports 2 types of variables that help to create sensor path templates. The variable supports letters, digits and symbols _ . $  
Variables:
    * **\*** - unnamed;
    * **{piece}** - named variable (can be used in **Label** input).  
  
   ***Example**. Folder filer = **Any**, Path template = **\*/Database/{db_name} size**. It means that all sensors will be added from any folder in any product where there is a **Database** node and the sensor name ends with **size**. Database name saved in **{db_name}** variable.*  

Source settings:
* **Label** - label for new source. It can use **Path template** variables.  
   ***Example**. Path template = **\*/Database/{db_name} size** sensor found by templates **Main product/Database/Journal size**. If Label is **{db_name} folder** the source name will look like **Journal folder**.*  
* **Property** - selected property for all sensors.
* **Shape** - default shape for all sources.

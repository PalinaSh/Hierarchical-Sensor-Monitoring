## New entity **Template** for Panels has been added
Panel templates allow you to quickly create and configure sensor sources. Template consists of 2 parts: Filter and Source settings.  

Filter part includes 2 parameters:
* **Folders** filter allows you to select in which folder you want to search for sensors. Supports multiselect logic. Default value is **Any**.
* **Path** template - sensor path template to be added to the Panel. It supports 2 types of variables that help to create sensor path templates. The variable supports letters, digits and symbols _ . $  
Variables:
    * **\*** - unnamed;
    * **{piece}** - named variable (can be used in **Label** input).  
  
   ***Example**. Folder filer = **Any**, Path template = **\*/Database/{db_name} size**. It means that all sensors will be added from any folder in any product where there is a **Database** node and the sensor name ends with **size**. Database name saved in **{db_name}** variable.*  

Source settings:
* **Label** - label for new source. It can use **Path template** variables.  
   ***Example**. Sensor **Main product/Database/Journal size** found using path template = **\*/Database/{db_name} size**. If Label is **{db_name} folder** the source label will look like **Journal folder**.*  
* **Property** - selected property for all sensors.
* **Shape** - default shape for all sources.

**How to create and apply panel Template**:
1. Select **Panel**.
1. Add new template by clicking on the **+Add** button next to the **Tempaltes** title.
1. Ð¡onfigure template fields.
1. After configuring the template, you need to click **Apply and Enable** item in template context menu.
1. The logic for scanning existing sensors starts. If everything is configured correctly, click to the **Enable** button.
